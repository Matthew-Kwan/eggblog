## Introduction
Hello :smile: This is a super random blog that I've decided to make. I've never really written seriously before (except for a rather embarassing anime blog), but I wanted to try and take this chance to explore a bit more and create something.

Realistically, I'm just going to be using this blog as an outlet for random things I come across that I find interesting and worth sharing. There is no theme. There is no standard. There is no pattern. There is no cadence.

Luckily, with this blog I got the fun opportunity to test out Hugo, and it's crazy how easy it is to get setup with it. I also like how it's written in Golang. It literally only took me a couple of seconds to figure this out. I'm interested to see if there are more things that I can set out to learn that actually matter enough for me to garner the need to write a post about it. Anyways, we'll see - I'm kinda interested in diving deep into Go and trying to become an expert with it. I've never personally felt super strong towards any language, but Go seems like it would be a good place to start.

## Topics
Potential topics can range from any of the below:
- Programming
- Food
- Fitness
- My Life
- Literally anything

Stay tuned :smile:
