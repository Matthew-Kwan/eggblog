It's that time of the year again, and yes I'm talking about sharing my goals for 2023 (in March)! There are some key technologies that I want to learn more about that I think would be beneficial for myself, but there are also some more general areas I want to focus on improving for myself, in order to become a better software engineer.

### Tech

**Golang**

I started a new job in January 2022, and I've been using Golang relatively intermittently through it. I want to dive deeper into the language and really gain proficieny in using it. One thought for myself is that I feel like I've never actually really become proficient in a language, at least not for software development. I might be able to say that I had a strong proficiency in Python for data analytics purposes, but that's about it. I want to really know Golang thoroughly, and be able to say that I'm a Go developer.

**Game Development**

I've loved video games for much of my life, but never really dug into how they were made. I don't yet know if I really have an affinity for game development, but I want to give it an earnest shot. My idea is to learn C# and try to pick up Unity for game development.

### General

**Not settling for a high-level understanding**
What a wordy topic, but I couldn't find a better way to put it. I think I often am okay with understanding something at a relatively high-level, and then running with that understanding. I've found that this has bit me in the back more than once in 2022, and I want to be more thorough in trying to comprehend the things that I learn about / do not know about.

**Learn to form my own opinion and value it**
I feel like I often do not have opinions on things, even for things that I'm actively working on. I want to be more conscious of my views on things, and not rely on other people to form an opinion for me to attach too. I want to try to internalize my own viewpoint on something, before hearing what others think about it.

## Conclusion

Welp, that about does it. If someone actually reads this, thank you, and I hope your day flows peacefully like a wonderfully runny egg!
